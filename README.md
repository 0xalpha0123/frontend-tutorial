# BasicFrontEndTutorial

 This is a step-by-step tutorial on how to deploy a Solidity smart contract, create a Front End and connect them together.
 We will use [Metamask](www.metamask.com), [Remix IDE](www.remix.ethereum.org) and [JQuery](https://jquery.com/). 
 
 By the end of this tutorial you will be able to create a basic HTML front end with buttons that can interact with smart contract functions.
